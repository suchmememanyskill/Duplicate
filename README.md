# Notice
[Alfae](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/Alfae) supersedes Duplicate in every way now, and thus i am depricating Duplicate.


# Duplicate
A cross-platform gui for legendary. Basically a game launcher that launches games from [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com)

I made this to easily add shortcuts to steam, so you can keep all your games in 1 place. Might be steam deck inspired

Note: The shortcuts generated in steam will launch duplicate, so that the launcher can tell the user if there's an issue, like not being logged in
